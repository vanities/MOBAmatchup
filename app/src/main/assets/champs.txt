Galio – the Sentinel’s Sorrow/Tank/Mage/Irelia, Yasuo, Malphite/Don’t clump together so Galio won’t be able to use Flash and his ultimate t CC your whole team. Avoid the target that Galio uses Bulwark on, as it will have greater defenses as well as heal Galio when they take damage./Galio

Heimerdinger – the Revered Inventor/Mage/Support/Xerath, Malzahar, Lux/Killing his turrents first when cast will greatly lower his damage output.

Illaoi – The Kraken Priestess/Fighter/Tank/Lulu, Tryndamere, Fiora/Avoid fighting her to close to her spawned tentacles. If she is hard focusing your soul, attack her while she’s doing it as you can do more damage to her than she can to you focusing your soul./Illaoi

Kayle – the Judicator/Fighter/Support/Pantheon, Gragas, Xin Zhao/A target that’s ulted by Kayle can still be CC’d, so you can still trap them until the Intervention duration wears off. Kayle naturally pushes lane so a good jungle camp will shut down a Kayle in lane easily./Kayle

Lulu – The Fae Sorceress/Support/Mage/Soraka, Orianna, Syndra/Lulu does not have any health sustaining abilities, so try to poke her down in lane. The damage from Pix can be avoided by standing amongst creeps to intercept the damage. Try not to get baited by her ultimate. Watch for level 6./Lulu

Nami – the Tidecaller/Support/Mage/Lulu, Ezreal, Fizz/Nami’s ultimate is very long, but it travels slowly. Try your best to get out of the way of the waves. Nami is really squishy in the early game. If you have a silence or an aggressive cc like Leona you can kill her quickly./Nami

RekSai – the Void Burrower/Fighter/None/Darius, Kennen, Jayce/Destroy any of her tunnels you find. Watch out for her fury bar, when she reaches max her E does true damage. CC’ing Rek’Sai while she’s tunneling won’t stop her. She’ll be cc’d afterwards./Rek%27Sai
Renekton – the Butcher of the Sands/Fighter/Tank/Trundle, Vayne, Kennen/Pay attention to Renekton’s fury bar, as he will most likely play aggressive when it turns red.
